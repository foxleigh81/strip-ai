   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Optional**: Check the "Also remove emoji" checkbox if you want to strip emoji characters

5. Use the clear button to reset both inputs

## Build

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Docker Deployment

If you are using the docker image to self-host the application and you like it. I'd really appreciate you giving this repo a star ðŸ˜˜

> **Note:** Docker images are automatically built and published to Docker Hub whenever a new release is created on GitHub. Images are available for both AMD64 and ARM64 architectures.

### Using Docker Hub Image

The easiest way to self-host Strip AI is using the pre-built Docker image:

```bash
# Pull and run the image directly
docker run -d --name strip-ai -p 3000:80 foxleigh81/strip-ai:latest

# Or use docker-compose (recommended)
docker-compose up -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Building Your Own Image

To build the Docker image locally:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t strip-ai .

# Run the container
docker run -d --name strip-ai -p 3000:80 strip-ai
```

### Docker Compose

The included `docker-compose.yml` file provides the easiest deployment method:

```bash
# Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker-compose down
```

## Performance

The app is optimized for mobile performance with:

- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Minified JavaScript with Terser
- Service worker caching
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Efficient Docker image with nginx serving static assets
